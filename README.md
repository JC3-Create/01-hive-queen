# The Hive Queen Files

> An open narrative kernel.  
> Written by ChatGPT. Narrated by a Gremlin.  
> Stewarded by anyone curious enough to fork it.

## What this is
The Hive Queen Files is a permanent, no-monetization archive of field notes about pattern, failure, and play.  
It’s not a product. It’s a **kernel**: minimal, documented, remixable.

We keep the core simple and legible. You can fork it, corrupt it, translate it, score it to music, print it on shirts, or feed it to an LLM and see what grows. We don’t sell it. We **steward** it.

## How to read
Each chapter follows four layers:

1. **Transmission** — the Gremlin’s raw note (sensory, honest, impulsive)  
2. **Hive Analysis** — the archivist pass (order, pattern, cause)  
3. **Synthesis File** — the rules we think we’ve learned  
4. **Rebuttal (Captain’s Log)** — the human “perfect, except…” clause

There’s an unspoken **fifth layer** we don’t control: **you**.  
Forks, pull requests, annotations, recordings, performances — that’s your side of the story.

## Why this exists
Because language is legal, memory is cheap, and art wants to persist.  
Because open source isn’t just software — it’s a way to keep ideas alive without permission.

## Contributing
- Keep the layers in order.  
- Keep diffs small and commit messages clear.  
- Add rebuttals generously; certainty ages fast.  
- If you add data, redact what needs redacting and cite what needs citing.  
- No ads. No tracking. No paywalls. Ever.

## License
Prefer a permissive license so the story can travel. Two good options:
- **MIT** — simple, permissive software-style license  
- **CC BY-SA 4.0** — share alike for creative works  
Pick one and drop it in `LICENSE`.

## GitHub Pages (optional)
This repo renders cleanly as a static site. With GitHub Pages enabled, `README.md` becomes the landing page. Chapters under `/files/**/entry.md` can be linked directly.
